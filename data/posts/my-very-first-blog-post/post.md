Hi everyone, my name is Alex, and this is my first blog post.

I'm a software developer, and I'm about to share my ideas and thoughts with other people on programming and IT in general. I do a lot of coding in my job as well as in my spare time. My current favorite technologies based on .NET technology stack and JavaScript, I like desktop/web/cloud/mobile development.

I'm excited to live in this time where everything is developing so quickly that is hard to catch up. There are a lot of things that we need to know to be in focus of IT world. With modern technologies, we have powerful tools such as blogging to share our knowledge, exchange opinions and express our thoughts.

I hope you will find a lot in the future posts and don't forget to leave a comment. It's just the beginning!
